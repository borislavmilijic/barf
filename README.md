# BARF Media Center

This repository contains multiple services managed through Docker Compose. Below you will find detailed descriptions of each service and their configurations. The main idea of this repo is to have those services ready to go in a matter of minutes, but also to recycle them anytime. Since multiple users in my household (and beyond) are using my immich and seafile server, I have exposed those services to the internet using tailscale and https securely using their [funnel](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel) service. My environment for running these services contains a Mac-Mini M2 running Docker + Synology DS413j. Every service used here (except the VPN Provider ofc - Mullvad in my case) is free of any charge. For all of the *arr services please read the [bible](https://trash-guides.info/).
